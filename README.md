## 3. Context and instructions

"People assume that time is a strict progression of cause to effect, but actually from a non-linear non-subjective viewpoint it's more like a big ball of wibbly wobbly timey wimey [stuff](https://youtu.be/cwdbLu_x0gY)."

Time War is finally over and the Doctor has just regenerated, so he can be a traveller once again and keep exploring time and space while battling injustice. All he has to do is going inside the TARDIS (Was that big inside all the time?ðŸ¤”), find a companion and have fun. But where is the TARDIS? More important, where is he? And why those angel statues are so sad?

It looks like the Doctor is in the middle of a labyrinth and the TARDIS is outside of it. Help the Doctor reaching the TARDIS with the arrow keys and avoid the Weaping Angels. There aren't any wrong path; there is the path that leads you to the TARDIS and you can find objects or a companion in the other paths.

"Don't turn your back, don't look away, and don't blink. Good luck."
