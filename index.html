        <p>Time War is finally over and the Doctor has just regenerated, so he can be a traveller once again and keep
            exploring time and space while battling injustice. All he has to do is going inside the TARDIS, find a
            companion and have fun. But where is the TARDIS? More important, where is he? And why those angel statues
            are so sad?</p>
        <p>It looks like the Doctor is in the middle of a labyrinth and the TARDIS is outside of it. Help the Doctor
            reach the TARDIS!</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Move with keyboard arrows.</li>
            <li>Avoid the weeping angels; if they trap the Doctor, you will start from the beginning.</li>
            <li>To win, the Doctor have to arrive to the TARDIS.</li>
            <li>There are three objects: a sonic screwdriver, a banana and a spoon. You don't need them to win, but it
                could help you win easily if you pick them all.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>"Don't turn your back, don't look away, and don't blink. Good luck."</p>
